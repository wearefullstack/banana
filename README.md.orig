# Banana

__NOTE__: You have reached the Banana repository. 
The Banana project is a fork of Kibana 3, which can be found at [http://three.kibana.org](http://three.kibana.org)
The goal is to port the code to work with Apache Solr as a backend storage. 
 
## IMPORTANT

All recent development has taken place on the "develop" branch. So pull the repo from the "develop" branch or the "release1.0" branch that will be created soon.

## Overview

Banana is Apache Licensed and serves as a visualizer and search interface to timestamped data sets stored in Solr, such as log files, Twitter streams, etc. Banana is designed to be easy to start-up with (just like Kibana from which it is forked). Data can be ingested into Solr through a variety of ways, including Solr Output Plug-in for LogStash, Flume and other connectors.

### Requirements
* A modern web browser. The latest version of Chrome, Safari and Firefox have been tested to work.
* A webserver. 
* A browser reachable Solr server. The Solr endpoint must be open, or a proxy configured to allow access to it.

### Installation and QuickStart

#### QuickStart for Complete SLK Stack

We have packaged Solr, the open Source LogStash with Solr Output Plug-in and Banana, along with default collections and dashboards to make it easy for you to get started. The package is available here  (Link to be added). Unzip the package and:  
1. Run Solr  

    cd slk4.7.0/solr-4.7.0/example-logs
    java -jar start.jar  
     
Browse to http://localhost:8983/banana 
 
You will see example dashboards which you can use as a starting point for your applications.
Once again, if you choose to run Solr on a different port, please edit the config.js file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
THAT'S IT!


#### Run Banana Web App within your existing Solr instance
Run Solr at least once to create the webapp directories  

		cd $SOLR_HOME/example  
		java -jar start.jar
		
Copy banana folder to $SOLR_HOME/example/solr-webapp/webapp/
 
Browse to http://localhost:8983/solr/banana/src/index.html#/dashboard



If your Solr port is different, edit banana/src/config.js and enter the port you are using.

If you have not created the data collections and ingested data into Solr, you will see an error message saying "No Index found at .." Go to the Solr Output Plug-in for LogStash QucickStart page to learn how to import data into your Solr instance

If you want to save and load dashboards from Solr, copy either solr-4.4.0/kibana-int or solr-4.5.0/kibana-int directories (as appropriate) into $SOLR_HOME/example/solr in order to setup the required core and restart Solr.



#### Running from a war file
Pull the develop or release1.0 branch. Run "ant" from within the banana directory to build the war file.

    cd $BANANA_REPO_HOME  
    ant 
     
The war file will be called banana-buildnumber.war and will be located in $BANANA_REPO_HOME/build  


Copy $BANANA_REPO_HOME/build/banana-buildnumber.war to $SOLR_HOME/example/webapps/banana.war   
Copy $BANANA_REPO_HOME/jetty/banana-context.xml  to $SOLR_HOME/example/contexts/      
Run Solr:

    cd $SOLR_HOME/example/
    java -jar start.jar    
=======
        cd $SOLR_HOME/example
        java -jar start.jar
    
2. Copy banana folder to $SOLR_HOME/example/solr-webapp/webapp/
3. Browse to [http://localhost:8983/solr/banana/src/index.html](http://localhost:8983/solr/banana/src/index.html)

_**NOTES:**_ If your Solr server/port is different from [localhost:8983](http://localhost:8983), edit
banana/src/config.js and banana/src/app/dashboards/default.json to enter the hostname and port that you are using.
Remember that banana runs within the client browser, so provide a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), because the
hostname and port number you provide should be resolvable from the client machines.

If you have not created the data collections and ingested data into Solr, you will see an error message saying
"Collection not found at .." You can use any connector to get data into Solr. If you want to use Logstash, please go to
the Solr Output Plug-in for [Logstash Page](https://github.com/LucidWorks/solrlogmanager) for code, documentation and
examples.

#### Option 2: Complete SLK Stack
Lucidworks has packaged Solr, Logstash (with a Solr Output Plug-in), and Banana (the Solr port of Kibana), along with
example collections and dashboards in order to rapidly enable proof-of-concepts and initial development/testing.
See [http://www.lucidworks.com/lucidworks-silk/](http://www.lucidworks.com/lucidworks-silk/).

#### Option 3: Building and installing from a WAR file
1. Pull the source code of Banana version that you want from the
[release](https://github.com/LucidWorks/banana/tree/release) branch in the repo;
For example, version *x.y.z* will be tagged as `x.y.z`.

2. Run a command line "ant" from within the banana directory to build the war file:

    ```bash
        cd $BANANA_REPO_HOME
        ant
    ```
3. The war file will be called *banana-\<buildnumber\>.war* and will be located in $BANANA\_REPO\_HOME/build.
Copy the war file and banana's jetty context file to Solr directories:
  * For Solr 5:

    ```bash
        cp $BANANA_REPO_HOME/build/banana-<buildnumber>.war $SOLR_HOME/server/webapps/banana.war
        cp $BANANA_REPO_HOME/jetty-contexts/banana-context.xml $SOLR_HOME/server/contexts/
    ```
  * For Solr 4:

    ```bash
        cp $BANANA_REPO_HOME/build/banana-<buildnumber>.war $SOLR_HOME/example/webapps/banana.war
        cp $BANANA_REPO_HOME/jetty-contexts/banana-context.xml $SOLR_HOME/example/contexts/
    ```
4. Run Solr:
  * For Solr 5:

    ```bash
        cd $SOLR_HOME/bin/
        ./solr start
    ```
  * For Solr 4:

    ```bash
        cd $SOLR_HOME/example/
        java -jar start.jar
    ```
5. Browse to [http://localhost:8983/banana](http://localhost:8983/banana) (or the FQDN of your Solr server).
>>>>>>> origin/fusion
    
Browse to http://localhost:8983/banana  

	
#### Banana Web App run in a WebServer

Edit config.js to point to the Solr server that will store the Kibana dashboards. You will need to make sure that a collection is created with the appropriate conf directory and schema.xml. Conf directories are available at banana/solr-4.4.0	(for Solr 4.4) and banana/solr-4.5.0 (for 4.5 and later).

The Solr server configured in config.js will serve as the default node for each dashboard; you can configure each dashboard to point to a different Solr endpoint as long as your webserver puts out the correct CORS headers.

Point your browser at your installation based on the contexts you have configured.



## FAQ

__Q__: How do I secure my solr endpoint so that users do not have access to it?   
__A__: The simplest solution is to use a nginx reverse proxy (See for example https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ajax-solr/pLtYfm83I98).

Banana preserves most of the features of Kibana (from which it is forked). If you have any questions, please contact Andrew Thanalertvisuti (andrew.thanalertvisuti@lucidworks.com) or Ravi Krishnamurthy (ravi.krishnamurthy@lucidworks.com).
